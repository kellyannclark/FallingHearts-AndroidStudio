# Overview

As a passionate software engineer dedicated to continuous learning and skill enhancement, I embarked on developing a mobile game that not only challenges players but also 
serves as a platform for me to explore and implement various programming concepts. This game, designed for Android devices, merges simple yet engaging gameplay with technical 
intricacies, offering both entertainment and a deeper understanding of software development.

In this game, players control a pair of hands at the bottom of the screen, aiming to catch falling hearts while avoiding devils. Hearts increase the player's score, while 
contact with devils deducts points. The game progresses with increasing speed and complexity, testing the player's reflexes and decision-making skills. The primary objective is 
to achieve the highest score possible before running out of points.

The motivation behind this software was to delve deeper into Android development, focusing on game development essentials such as real-time entity management, collision detection, 
and rendering techniques. This project allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical, creative manner, furthering my understanding of mobile application development.

# Development Environment

The development of this game was facilitated by a range of tools and technologies tailored for Android application development. Key among these was Android Studio, the official 
integrated development environment (IDE) for Android, which provided a comprehensive toolkit for designing, coding, and testing the game.

The game was written in Java, a versatile and widely-used programming language that offers robust support for Android development. Java's object-oriented nature was instrumental 
in structuring the game's entities and logic. Additionally, the Android SDK was used extensively, providing libraries and APIs necessary for leveraging Android's hardware and
software capabilities.
